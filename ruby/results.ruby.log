      ** Notice: The native BSON extension was not loaded. **

      For optimal performance, use of the BSON extension is recommended.

      To enable the extension make sure ENV['BSON_EXT_DISABLED'] is not set
      and run the following command:

        gem install bson_ext

      If you continue to receive this message after installing, make sure that
      the bson_ext gem is in your load path.
